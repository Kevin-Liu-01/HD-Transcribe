# HD Transcribe

HD Transcribe provides a speech-to-text function that allows Huntington's Disease patients to communicate with others more easily.

To allow Huntington&apos;s Disease patients to communicate more
easily and improve their quality of life, this project aims to
produce a deep-learning voice recognition algorithm that can
understand HD patients&apos; speech. This algorithm will
specifically be trained with audio clips of HD patients and
transcripts of their words.
